      <div class="pt-4 pb-20 markdown"><p>Recently I’ve been working with repos that have multiple languages and build systems rolled into one. Talking about iOS/Android/Rust/Node/React Native/Flutter. The plethora of build systems, tools and quirks brings a lot of complexity, specially when working within a team, where every one needs to be able to run the same commands to build, test, lint, etc.</p>

<h1 id="previous-art">Previous Art</h1>

<p>From working with other teams, each language/ecosystem have their own way of doing things. Some of the common patterns I’ve seen are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The god awfulness that is cmake, frankensteined to work with modern tools, such as Rust. Works for simple flows, but breaks-down once you need to start parsing params, setting variables, etc.</li>
  <li>Writing lots of Rust to perform as a shell scripting tool. Hard to read/write as one is creating a DSL on top of Rust. Usually, takes the name of xtask, there is even a <a href="https://docs.rs/xtasks/latest/xtasks/">crate</a> aimed at automating some of this pain.</li>
  <li>Npm tasks that run bash scripts</li>
  <li>Raw dogging node scripts that spawn processes</li>
  <li>There are ofc other tools like <code>make</code>, <code>rake</code>, <code>Ninja</code>, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s a wild west. These all work but require too much finagling to get right. I wanted something that was simple, easy to read, and easy to write. Preferible in a language/ecosystem that I know. JS is the easiest one, but then it’s one more tool in the chain that my team needs to install, but then found a tooling pair that allows for one install command that takes care of everything.</p>

<h1 id="mise">Mise</h1>

<p>I’m a big fan of tool managers. Journey started with <code>asdf</code> and I’m now using <code>mise</code>. <code>mise</code> is a tool manager that allows you to install tools from a single file. It’s like a package manager for languages/runtimes/tasks/etc. It basically allows you to define a single <code>mise.toml</code> where you can have per folder tools.</p>

<p>Let’s say, I can have the specific bun/node version that I need my team to have. Without having to seat down with them to uninstall their manual node installation, install nvm, then update their Rust version. etc etc.</p>

<h1 id="bun-shell">Bun Shell</h1>

<p>The <a href="Bun Shell"><code>Bun Shell</code></a> is bun’s integrated way of running terminal commands within TypeScript. The beauty of this, is the easyness of using TypeScript to manipulate and pipe the output of commands, rather than the clunkyness of bash.</p>

<h1 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together</h1>

<p>At the end, I have a <code>mise.toml</code> that looks like this (this is just an example):</p>

<pre><code class="language-toml">[tools]
node = "14.18.1"
bun = "0.1.0"
rust = "1.58.0"

[hooks]
postinstall = "bun install"

[tasks]
build = "bun zx scripts/build.mts"
</code></pre>

<p>And a <code>scripts/build.mts</code> that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ts">import { $ } from "bun";

// You can do more things here, like parse the arguments, import other files, etc
await $`cargo build --release`;
await $`flutter build ios`;
</code></pre>

<p>Then on the README for my team it gets simple boils down to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>brew install mise</code></li>
  <li><code>mise settings experimental=true</code>, this is needed to enable the hooks, will go away in the future</li>
  <li><code>mise install</code></li>
  <li><code>mise build</code> to build the project. On my project I have extended this with params like <code>mise build ios debug</code> to build the iOS app in debug mode.</li>
</ul>

<p>No more fighting with tool versions, no more fighting with build systems. Everyone is on the same versions, with a reproducible yet native environment, with a single entry point for scripts and the scripts themselves written in a non-retarded language.</p>

      <div class="pt-4 pb-20 markdown text-justify"><p>I have a DJI Mini Pro drone (had the 3 two times and lost them, and now a 4). I love this little thing. However, I have a few issues with this delicate piece of technology.</p>

<p>First one that seems non-solvable are transfer speeds. The 3 would do 10 to 20 mbits/s transfer. This new one seems to be a lot slower 1 to 3 mbits/second. Scouring online, seems to suggest one needs to turn off celullar data and the issue might go away. Big problem, but nothing I can do about that.</p>

<p>However, I had a more serious issue the other day. Here are some steps for those unlucky souls like me.</p>

<p>When entering quick-transfer mode all of the sudden none of the pictures/videos would show in the gallery. All I got was a “Failed to load, tap to try again” message on the screen.</p>

<p>I did all I could think off:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Drone, controller and app where updated</li>
  <li>Check SD card on computer</li>
  <li>Format SD card</li>
  <li>Reset all settings on drone</li>
  <li>Mutiple restarts, with SD card out, letting the drone sit idle, etc.</li>
  <li>Try a different SD card</li>
</ul>

<p>I got in touch with DJI support, they pointed me to <a href="https://www.dji.com/jp/downloads/softwares/dji-assistant-2-consumer-drones-series">one tool</a> they have to reflash the firmware</p>

<p>After multiple reflashes and a downgrade, it was still not working. I was about to give up when just clicking through the settings I noticed the internal storage had 0 free space (should have 2 gb). Knowning what I know about computers, this was a desperate last attempt to get it working. I formated the internal storage and voila! All of the sudden the gallery started working again.</p>

<p>This is clearly an oversight on DJI’s firmware. Lack of error messages/user feedback to debug the issue. Etc. At least I got the drone back in working order, so hopefully this will be useful to others.</p>

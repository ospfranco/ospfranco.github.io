I’m a fan of JS type checkers, flow is not my favorite, but what is important is that it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when I joined the company I was surprised on how slow Flow was in our project. The project is large but not extremely large. Facebook codebase is orders of magnitude bigger, yet this is the performance I see sometimes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/hloQX8wG0t0&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon saving this file, flow triggers a ~420 file dependency check and takes ~10 seconds to actually report any type errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;check-that-nothing-else-is-wrongly-set-up&quot;&gt;Check that nothing else is wrongly set up&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First I started checking nothing was poorly set up in our project. A lot of the debugging &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68833468/how-to-debug-flowtype-extreme-slow-performance?noredirect=1#comment121793043_68833468&quot;&gt;help came from Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt; and other people with flow experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the things I tried:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deleting flow-typed definitions: sometimes they contain cycles or redundant definitions which can slow down flow&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Got rid of circular dependencies: we had 2 - 3 circular dependencies in our code&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shuffled around types: Moved types here and there to no avail&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Messed around with the .flowconfig: set up LSP, lazy mode FS, changed max workers, toggled various flags&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Blamed the plugin: I’m using the FB plugin for flow on VSCode, which does seems to over-query the flow server on each keystroke, tried another plugin which only queries on save, feels like a minor improvement but still slow&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tried several small flow repos: none experienced this slow down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;assume-flow-is-actually-right&quot;&gt;Assume flow is actually right&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flow is a large project and facebook depends on it, so the chances that it is doing something wrong are slim, but I couldn’t believe making a change on certain file, did indeed trigger a 400+ file check. I needed to make sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I scoured the web trying to find out how debug the type dependency tree, but found nothing. The biggest pain point for me about flow, is the utter lack of documentation and community, the flow team also pays very little attention to the outside world and their priority is to support the facebook codebase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After many hours ended up figuring out the right command to output the entire dependency graph for the app:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;yarn flow graph dep-graph &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--strip-root&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--out&lt;/span&gt; ./output
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This however it only produces the entire app graph… you can imagine this file is hundred thousand of lines of dependencies. In any case, this outputs a DOT file (from graphviz), which in theory you can easily visualize by using the right command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# install dot via &quot;brew install graphviz&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# I tried a png first... it just fails&lt;/span&gt;

dot &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-Tsvg&lt;/span&gt; output &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-o&lt;/span&gt; graph.svg
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This produces an svg so massive and so filled with squigly lines it is effectively useless… so I had to narrow down the output to just an entry file which I’m interested. Unfortunately the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;graph&lt;/code&gt; command does not take an entry point to generate the graph, so I had to manually narrow down the graph that I had. Here is the gist with the script I ended up coming up with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/ospfranco/d599a68f1a2fe1f39a457162238fec78.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Note: I removed the first and last line of the graph file before passing it to the script&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This allowed me to crawl through the entries and finally specify an entry point to the sub-tree that interested me. Once narrowed down, I could finally produce another visualization, and the result is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ospfranco.com/assets/flowdep1.png&quot; alt=&quot;flowdep1&quot; title=&quot;flowdep1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terrible! But not all is useless, I can see the direct imports from the file are correct… and I can indeed see things spiral out of control, importing certain files ends up pulling the entire application code!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ospfranco.com/assets/flowdep2.png&quot; alt=&quot;flowdep1&quot; title=&quot;flowdep1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The count of objects in this sub-graph also seems to match closely the output produced by flow, this sub-graph has 415 nodes and the editor triggers a 420 file re-check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well… it seems to me Flow is doing nothing wrong, it indeed produces the correct dependency graph, but rather that our import structure has grown unchecked so large over the years that we have some architectural mistakes we cannot escape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current analysis is that Redux and Sagas are mostly to blame, the boiler plate nature of it and the coupling of action creators, action definitions and the reducers into single files ends up creating this web of dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some very abstract suggestions for those along this path:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do not place your action definitions (and creators if you use them) inside the same files as your reducers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The moment you start seeing a performance degradation in your type checking, is the time to figure out why, pushing the can down the road will lead to trouble.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Come up with a sane import architecture, minimizing the dependencies between separate files. I think I will write about this in the future.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find the original thread here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;You probably need a lot less than what you think&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since 2 months ago I work only from Monday to Wednesday and it&amp;#39;s life changing, now I get to go surfing on a Thursday at 10:00&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is why I did it and why you should too&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;🧵 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/gqJzVAwAVi&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/gqJzVAwAVi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Oscar (@ospfranco) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ospfranco/status/1425765893590638592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;August 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First some context, I started working around 10 years ago with a off-shoring software company in Bolivia, pay was good(ish) but the attitude of the people running the company was so terrible, some were americans but the CEO was US-born/Bolivian, and they basically saw the local developers as cheap nerds but nothing else. Lasted 6 months in the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I freelanced for some years, there I earned a bunch of money (due to Bolivia being so cheap and salary in USD) and was actually a very entertaining time for me, learned a lot and had a lot of freedom. After some time I got bored of working alone and wanted to try something new and decided to move to Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is where the wild ride starts. Unlike in Bolivia where I was a gun for hire, this time I got to see the software industry close and personal. The dreams of money and success, the buzz of silicon valley reaching its tendrils all the way to Europe. Work is work, but the tech industry (currently) attracts every hustler on the scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I basically ended up working for a bunch of start ups, each progressively worst for my physical and mental health, and I wasn’t alone, co-workers ended up doing therapy or we still talk/get together to process what happened to us during this times. The constant push, combined with the lack of basic human decency is soul-crushing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So around the beginning of 2020 I had the nose full, I quit the last start-up and spend some months recovering, I was planning on going back to freelancing, but the pandemic made me uncertain if I could achieve it… so I decided to join a small bootstrapped company with a single app as a revenue source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many good things about small-bootstrapped; no impossible and imaginary deadlines, very little planning overhead or planning at all (can be both bad and good), there are also some bad things; work is sometimes chaotic and tedious, and very little room for making your own decisions. And around half a year ago I was wondering if I should start looking for a new position, since I was started to feel stuck and bored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But given my previous experiences, were could I go? Everyone and their grandma is aiming for the unicorn start-up dream, almost exclusively a loosing bet (since 95% die after a couple of years anyways), I didn’t want to go back to the stress and no-life of working in a high-pressure environment, so I came up with an idea: Even though current work was not the most exciting, it was completely manageable and paid well enough for me not to complain, the problem is that I could not bring myself to doing it 5 days of the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The owners of the company like me, so we agreed to reduce the working hours to 60%, three work days a week… and let me tell you, my quality of life SKYROCKETED, I haven’t feel this satisfied with life since I left college and I felt the world is filled with possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the run down of how my week works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mon to Wed: Normal work, when work is good/entertaining actually quite enjoyable, because for a few days a week I get to work on a team, also not responsible for high-level decisions, just come do some work, get paid for it. If work is bad, it’s almost over immediately, I only need to push through for a couple of days and then it’s over for 4 days, by next week either some situations have resolved themselves or I feel energized again to tackle the problems&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Thu to Fri: I get to focus on my own projects, I write blog posts, I do open source, I explore ideas for bootstrapping my own company, but it’s super flexible, I sometimes go surfing, running, hiking, everything is super empty because most people are stuck at work. And even though I work, it does not feel like work!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sat: Sometimes I work a bit more but try not to do the same time of work… usually stop around noon and meet with friends to other stuff on the evening&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sun: For the first time since I was 20… I do nothing, by the time Sunday comes around, I have already done so much of the stuff I wanted to get done, that I for once get to do NOTHING, I watch so movies, go do some sport, meet with friends without the guilt I would usually feel of not hustling, and it feels SO liberating, it’s really hard to put into words&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some very real downsides: I took a significant pay cut. A company reached out to me a few weeks ago, they offered me a salary bump and stocks over my current position, but I had to go back to full time job… I couldn’t bring myself to do it. If you live in the developed world maybe you understand my position. A 10/20k salary increase does not change my life at all, buying an apartment/house is still hopelessly impossible, I don’t have a car (nor I want to) and my free time consists of almost free activities (being outdoors is IMHO is the best thing you can do for your life).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out, the secret to my happiness was not to chase money down the beaten path whilst enduring a work-life that made me miserable, but rather to get rid of this way (or at least reduce it to it’s minimum while still reaping most/some of the benefits).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Oscar Franco</name></author><category term="post" /><summary type="html">The other day I posted a twitter thread about how my quality of life massively improved after I started working only 3 days per week, but twitter is a poor medium and I feel like I still have a couple of things to say.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://ospfranco.com/assets/preview.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://ospfranco.com/assets/preview.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Fix slow terminal start (hanging xcodebuild)</title><link href="https://ospfranco.com/post/2021/08/05/fix-slow-terminal-start-(hanging-xcodebuild)/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Fix slow terminal start (hanging xcodebuild)" /><published>2021-08-05T15:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2021-08-05T15:00:00+02:00</updated><id>https://ospfranco.com/post/2021/08/05/fix%20slow%20terminal%20start%20(hanging%20xcodebuild)</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ospfranco.com/post/2021/08/05/fix-slow-terminal-start-(hanging-xcodebuild)/">&lt;p&gt;Starting somewhere last year, something happened to the terminal on bigsur, on every clean start up it would hang for many seconds until the prompt was there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some people who have found some solutions, I tried all of them until it &lt;strong&gt;something&lt;/strong&gt; worked, so here is a compilation for you to try as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;xcode-tools&quot;&gt;Xcode tools&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some the problem seemed to be they did not accept the license:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;xcodebuild &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-license&lt;/span&gt; accept
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Related to this, could be that the command line tools are not properly installed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the interest of time this is what seemed to have worked for me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo rm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-rf&lt;/span&gt; /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;xcode-select &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--install&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;xcode-select &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-switch&lt;/span&gt; /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;install-git-via-brew&quot;&gt;Install git via brew&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some the problem seems to be the integrated git version, replace it via brew:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;brew &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;git
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;install-zsh-via-brew&quot;&gt;Install zsh via brew&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others report that the zsh version that comes with mac is old, replace it with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;brew &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;zsh
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;try-messing-with-nvm&quot;&gt;Try messing with NVM&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One user reports having a nvm default alias caused the issue for him:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Tried all Google results and nothing works. Eventually, I found it was caused by setting Node.js v8.x as default in nvm, alias default to system will resolve the issue. Although I don’t know why nvm need to run xcodebuild for Node.js v8.x.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;debug-your-zshrc-or-zprofile-script&quot;&gt;Debug your .zshrc (or .zprofile) script&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the slowdown could be caused by some extra step, I had a different problem with one of the apps I use, you can see what happens when you start a zsh session with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;zsh &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up trying a bunch of things here, disabling some plugins, nvm, trying to lazy load components&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;check-the-multiple-files-that-zsh-loads&quot;&gt;Check the multiple files that zsh loads&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zsh loads a lot of files for configuration, it could be possible (not in my case), that some of this is poorly configured, worth a try if you already tried everything above:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;https://shreevatsa.wordpress.com/2008/03/30/zshbash-startup-files-loading-order-bashrc-zshrc-etc/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this will solve your problem, mine was fixed somewhere between installing zsh via brew and re-installing the xcode-tools&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Oscar Franco</name></author><category term="post" /><summary type="html">Starting somewhere last year, something happened to the terminal on bigsur, on every clean start up it would hang for many seconds until the prompt was there.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://ospfranco.com/assets/preview.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://ospfranco.com/assets/preview.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Migrate React Native’s AppDelegate to Swift</title><link href="https://ospfranco.com/post/2021/07/31/migrate-rn-appdelegate-to-swift/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Migrate React Native’s AppDelegate to Swift" /><published>2021-07-31T15:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2021-07-31T15:00:00+02:00</updated><id>https://ospfranco.com/post/2021/07/31/migrate%20rn%20appdelegate%20to%20swift</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ospfranco.com/post/2021/07/31/migrate-rn-appdelegate-to-swift/">&lt;p&gt;It’s no secret that JS developers run away from Objective-C, why not migrate the entry point of your app to Swift?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just bare in mind, this won’t make your app completely run on Swift, just the entry point, but at least it should be easier to understand at least the basic methods and entry points of other libraries/functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tutorial was created with RN 0.64&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;1-delete-appdelegateh-appdelegatem-and-mainm&quot;&gt;1. Delete AppDelegate.h, AppDelegate.m and main.m&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just delete this files, we won’t need them. There is one caveat here though, as time passes the code inside of the original AppDelegate might change to what is on this post, so pay attention on your own to see if any changes are necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;2-create-an-appdelegateswift&quot;&gt;2. Create an AppDelegate.swift&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right-click the base folder -&amp;gt; New file… -&amp;gt; Swift file -&amp;gt; AppDelegate.swift, after you create it XCode should ask you if you want to create a Bridging header file, click on yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The content of the new &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AppDelegate.swift&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;3-fill-the-bridging-header&quot;&gt;3. Fill the bridging header&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On your bridging header put the following content:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;#import &amp;lt;React/RCTBridgeModule.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;#import &amp;lt;React/RCTBridge.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;#import &amp;lt;React/RCTEventDispatcher.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;#import &amp;lt;React/RCTRootView.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;#import &amp;lt;React/RCTUtils.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;#import &amp;lt;React/RCTConvert.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;#import &amp;lt;React/RCTBundleURLProvider.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;4-fix-swift-compilation&quot;&gt;4. Fix swift compilation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you try to build the application you will get some errors regarding missing swift dependencies, I can’t really explain why this is happening, but in order to solve it go to your project build setting’s and change the library search paths as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the project wide settings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ospfranco.com/assets/swift_project_settings.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Project settings&quot; title=&quot;Project settings&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delete the old entries and replace them with a single entry looking for the swift-5.2 libraries&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the target settings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ospfranco.com/assets/swift_target_settings.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Target settings&quot; title=&quot;Target settings&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add a new entry just like the one you left at the project level settings&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;5-profit&quot;&gt;5. Profit&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should now be able to compile your React Native application!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As stated this doesn’t mean that your app is now running on Swift, but might make it easier for you to add functionality on the native side of things. I started this work because I’m looking into turbo modules and objective-c is just too damn hard to understand to the untrained eye, so I’m expecting it will help me solve the mysteries of enabling Turbo Modules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t used technique in production, so integrating other libraries in an open question for me. The lifecycle methods should be easy enough for you to figure out, but importing and calling obj-c libraries might require a bit of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This technique was inspired by the work I did on my React Native for macOS online course, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newline.co/courses/building-react-native-apps-for-mac&quot;&gt;check it out&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Oscar Franco</name></author><category term="post" /><summary type="html">It’s no secret that JS developers run away from Objective-C, why not migrate the entry point of your app to Swift?</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://ospfranco.com/assets/preview.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://ospfranco.com/assets/preview.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Reviewing Github’s Copilot</title><link href="https://ospfranco.com/post/2021/07/24/reviewing-githubs-copilot/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Reviewing Github’s Copilot" /><published>2021-07-24T15:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2021-07-24T15:00:00+02:00</updated><id>https://ospfranco.com/post/2021/07/24/reviewing-githubs-copilot</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ospfranco.com/post/2021/07/24/reviewing-githubs-copilot/">&lt;p&gt;Is github copilot even worth it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Github’s Copilot is an AI assistant, trained on github’s vast codebase (including repos with disparate OSS licenses), it aims to fill the gaps by throwing code at your face while you go about your day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to go into technical details, all I can give is my impressions after trying it a couple of days&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;first-it-amazed-me&quot;&gt;First it amazed me&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I installed the extension and carried on with my day, I paid a lot of attention to it. I also gave it a lot of slack, I knew even though it was trained with a huge codebase mistakes would be the name of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I as I went coding my tasks, I would stop and pay attention to the code that was being offered to me, sometimes it would shorten small boilerplate statements, create this variable, autocomplete a hook, it was fun despite failing on the real logic heavy stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The highlight came when I had to write a regular expression, I dislike regular expressions, which means I’m not skilled enough to write them with ease. I struggled to create a first version of the regex I needed, and when I moved to another file and I had to re-use it, Copilot dropped a valid regex on my lap. I won’t lie, my jaw dropped, it was more complete that the one I had written, later I modified the code a bit and it spit out a new regex that reflected those changes. Amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;but-is-it-actually-correct&quot;&gt;But is it actually correct?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I immediately took the regex that was suggested, assuming it was correct, only to realize later, that the functionality I was coding was broken. I started the debugging the code and realized the problem was in the regex given by Copilot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all my disliking for regexes I accepted the suggestion without a second thought. I ended up going back to my original regex and slowly creating the correct version. And here is one of the dangers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;i-believe-there-is-no-substitute-for-the-human-brain&quot;&gt;I believe there is no substitute for the human brain&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copilot, despite being the amazing fact we are able to create it, is still a &lt;strong&gt;dumb&lt;/strong&gt; machine. &lt;strong&gt;It doesn’t understand where you want to go, only where where it has been&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fear that bug production will be automated, since we are tempted to always take the path of less resistance and accept the suggestions without thorough checking. Not that humans are perfect at this, the real question is if Copilot can do better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;and-then-it-got-annoying&quot;&gt;And then it got annoying&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after my excitement died down and I tried to continue to do my work, things got bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I tried to focus in order to write complex pieces of code, Copilot keep throwing code at me whenever I took a brief pause to gather my thoughts, this completely broke my flow state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the sudden I was looking at code that most of the time was: a) wrong, b) wrong but hard to notice why it was wrong or c) hot garbage because it did something completely different. This got tiring fast, instead of focusing the problem at hand I was focusing on correcting errors already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After half a day, it felt like having a junior dev next to me, constantly interrupting and throwing code at my face… almost there code, but still wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-now-what&quot;&gt;So… now what?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure it will get better, the question is… how much better can it get? I don’t know&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it useful sometimes, sure, at least to me it saved me a couple of keystrokes every once in a while&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the constant distraction is 100% not worth it to me, I have now removed the extension. I can only wish the Copilot’s team good luck and await for the next iteration!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Oscar Franco</name></author><category term="post" /><summary type="html">Is github copilot even worth it?</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://ospfranco.com/assets/profile.jpeg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://ospfranco.com/assets/profile.jpeg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">100€ MRR as an Indie Hacker</title><link href="https://ospfranco.com/post/2021/05/25/100-bucks-per-month-as-indie-hacker/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="100€ MRR as an Indie Hacker" /><published>2021-05-25T15:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2021-05-25T15:00:00+02:00</updated><id>https://ospfranco.com/post/2021/05/25/100-bucks-per-month-as-indie-hacker</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ospfranco.com/post/2021/05/25/100-bucks-per-month-as-indie-hacker/">&lt;p&gt;I am a (painfully) average developer. I do not make millions. I have not created complex trading algorithms, programs or businesses. I have a good yet average paying job. My group of friends are (in the nicest way possible) as average as I am, none of us has reached massive success, some might have stocks, but &lt;strong&gt;we work for a living.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My clique is however heavily skewed towards tech people; developers, managers, product-designers and it blows my mind how inflated our dreams and egos are. We sit in high-towers where most of us are not happy with our high salaries and comfortable lifestyle. We chase the latest news to invest in the stock market, we jump companies every couple of years trying to become millionaires. The market and the tech ecosystem has ruined us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year I launched &lt;a href=&quot;https://ospfranco.github.io/cidemon&quot;&gt;CI Demon&lt;/a&gt; and whenever I tell my tech friends I make 100€ per month they literally laugh about it. You can tell they are like “thats funny, you need to market it! you need to sell more!”. However when I tell my non-tech friends the reaction is completely different: “wow! that’s amazing!” or “that’s great and you don’t have to work much to make that!”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does 100€ per month mean to non-tech people, nothing, because they have been brain-washed into looking at computers as a million dollar business. The crazy thing is: they cash a normal salary like me, yet they only consider businesses with returns of multiple zeroes as something worth chasing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is incredibly dumb, and here is why; 100€/month is &lt;strong&gt;1200€/year that goes straight into my pocket&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It means a great vacation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It means visit my family in my homecountry&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1200€ for non-tech people is a good salary bump, for which many still have to work 40+ hours weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Even for tech workers&lt;/strong&gt; 1200€ is still a salary bump you need to ask your boss for&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I can say, it makes me super happy, I get to create something, which is fun for me, it also generates side-income with very little time spent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wake up people, the chances of you becoming a billionaire are slim to none, it’s much better to be happy and having enough instead of chasing money every waking hour.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Oscar Franco</name></author><category term="post" /><summary type="html">I am a (painfully) average developer.

&lt;p&gt;A lot of online say you need to open the Keychain app to get the WiFi password, but that trick stopped working long ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WiFi passwords on macOS are now encrypted and going into the Keychain does nothing for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately there is no visual app (that I know of) that can extract the password for you, but you can run a simple script that will prompt you for your user password and then output the current network password.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wifi-password-script&quot;&gt;WiFi password script&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the first that you can do to get a WiFi password is download and save this script:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Required parameters:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# @raycast.schemaVersion 1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# @raycast.title Show WiFi Password&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# @raycast.mode silent&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Optional parameters:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# @raycast.icon 📶&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# @raycast.packageName Show WiFi Password&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Documentation:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# @raycast.author Oscar&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# @raycast.authorURL https://github.com/ospfranco&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# The script is originally from Guillermo Rauch, all credit goes to him, all I did was add the Raycast headers&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# https://github.com/rauchg/wifi-password&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;0.1.0&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# locate airport(1)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;ERROR: Can't find &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;airport&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt; CLI program at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$airport&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Call it from a terminal, you need to share the password with a third party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-it-with-the-raycast-app&quot;&gt;Using it with the Raycast app&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But actually, there is a better way, you should download &lt;a href=&quot;https://raycast.com&quot;&gt;Raycast&lt;/a&gt;, it’s an awesome app and allows you to directly call scripts. Once you have Raycast installed, you can directly call this script from it (put it in your &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;documents&lt;/code&gt; folder), it will immediately output the WiFi password ready for you to paste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of the script in action:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever I tried to compile the app for android, I would face a very random error:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':app:processGmsDebugResources'.
&amp;gt; Problems reading data from Binary store in /private/var/folders/qn/vyvn49j90jv9_77vq77wzvw00000gn/T/gradle7617438234756331878.bin offset 0 exists? true
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is particularly frustrating because there was absolutely no change from my side. I still haven’t been able to figure out the root cause, but after reading some of the github issues; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/8489&quot;&gt;a gradle issue that has nothing to do with RN&lt;/a&gt; and the seemingly related &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/zo0r/react-native-push-notification/issues/1999#issuecomment-840235222&quot;&gt;rn-push-notification issue&lt;/a&gt;. From what I gatter the cause seems to be Google pushing an update to their libraries messaging and breaking our precious compilation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in order to save you some time here is the solution, update the following dependencies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;project app-level build.gradle file:
com.google.firebase:firebase-analytics:17.2.2 to com.google.firebase:firebase-analytics:18.0.2

Project-level build.gradle file:
com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.3 to com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.5
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;react-native-push-notification&lt;/code&gt; (actually seems to be the root of this problem), you also need to update that library to the latest version (&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;7.3.1&lt;/code&gt; as of this writing). Bare in mind this might be a major version change, so the API might have changed, in our case we were using a 6.X.X version and we had to update the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;removeAllDeliveredNotifications&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards your app should hopefully compile.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Oscar Franco</name></author><category term="post" /><summary type="html">If you work with React Native this week has been a lot of fun, your app might have magically stopped compiling all of the sudden (or as in my case when the gradle cache was invalidated in the CI and in my local builds).</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Github workflows chaining</title><link href="https://ospfranco.com/post/2021/05/10/how-to-trigger-a-github-actions-workflow-from-another-workflow/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Github workflows chaining" /><published>2021-05-10T15:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2021-05-10T15:00:00+02:00</updated><id>https://ospfranco.com/post/2021/05/10/how-to-trigger-a-github-actions-workflow-from-another-workflow</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ospfranco.com/post/2021/05/10/how-to-trigger-a-github-actions-workflow-from-another-workflow/">&lt;p&gt;Here is another post that has to do with my current company migrating CI systems, from Bitrise into Github Actions. While on Bitrise we had workflows that would trigger (fork) more workflows. This worked well for us to trigger our android, iOS and Huawei builds with a single click.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, after migrating to Github Actions, it’s not quite clear how to achieve the same. There are some posts on the forums that point to old answers using personal tokens. I lost some time googling around, so I thought I might save the next guy time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past Github prevented triggering workflows from other workflows to prevent recursive triggers. However at some point they added another trigger, so instead of dispatching a build from a parent, you declare a dependency on the child workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of a parent workflow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-yml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Fork production builds&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;workflow_dispatch&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;jobs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;say_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;runs-on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;ubuntu-latest&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Hi&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;echo &quot;Hi&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You need to have jobs with a step, otherwise github complains, but this entire workflow runs in less than a second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and on the child workflow, you just add it to the triggers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-yml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Android HMS Production&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Automatic trigger when pushing tags&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# push:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#   branches:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#     - &quot;!*&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#   tags:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#     - 'v*'&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Manual trigger from the UI&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;workflow_dispatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;inputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Build&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;description'&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Dependency to a forking workflow&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;workflow_run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;workflows&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Fork&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;production&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;builds&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;complete&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The ‘complete’ type is just so that this workflow triggers after the previous one has been completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it, now when you trigger the “Fork production builds” (from the github UI), the child (or children) process will run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want even more details about your CI builds and workflows on github, you should check &lt;a href=&quot;https://ospfranco.github.io/cidemon&quot;&gt;CI Demon&lt;/a&gt;, it’s an app that I made that puts your builds right on your mac Desktop.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Oscar Franco</name></author><category term="post" /><summary type="html">Here is another post that has to do with my current company migrating CI systems, from Bitrise into Github Actions.

It works based on tokens to authenticate with the CI providers APIs. Sometimes to generate this tokens is not quite straightforward, so here is a simple guide for github tokens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;about-ci-demon&quot;&gt;About CI Demon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t heard about CI Demon, it is a macOS status bar application. Instead of waiting for entire web apps to low to see if your build has passed or failed, it puts the a simple status icon on your macOS status bar. When open it shows you a list of PRs, branches or even endpoints for you to quickly fix/attend to any issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/small_ci_demon.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;CI Demon preview&quot; title=&quot;CI demon preview&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As stated it works based on tokens, the thing is, this tokens never leave your computer, they are all stored on the macOS keychain, so no need for you to worry what I do with your personal information (I don’t do anything because I don’t have access to them).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;generating-a-github-token&quot;&gt;Generating a Github token&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most tight integration is with github and sometimes people have some problems adding their tokens into the app, so let’s walkthrough generating a token.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;open-githubcom&quot;&gt;Open github.com&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First you want to open github and go to your account settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/CIDemonTut1.png&quot; alt=&quot;CI tut 1&quot; title=&quot;CI tut 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;go-to-developer-settings&quot;&gt;Go to Developer settings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You then go to developer settings options&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/CIDemonTut2.png&quot; alt=&quot;CI tut 2&quot; title=&quot;CI tut 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;select-personal-access-tokens&quot;&gt;Select personal access tokens&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should now see a list of your personal tokens, you create a new one clicking in the generate new token button. (You might be prompted to input your password).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/CIDemonTut3.png&quot; alt=&quot;CI tut 3&quot; title=&quot;CI tut 3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;create-the-token&quot;&gt;Create the token&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can put a note in the token, I just put CI Demon in case I one day forget why I created that specific token, on the permissions you want to give it only the necessary permissions. Giving it repo access is enough, unfortunately you cannot give it read-only access, but I promise you the app is strictly read only (with the exception of re-triggering builds).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards you will see your token, copy and paste it, this will be your only chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/CIDemonTut4.png&quot; alt=&quot;CI tut 4&quot; title=&quot;CI tut 4&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;add-it-to-ci-demon&quot;&gt;Add it to CI Demon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On CI Demon, on the settings menu, go to github actions and paste your token in there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now there is a small inconvenience here, due to some API limitations, you have to manually specify which repositories you want to watch, so here put your repository &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;slug&lt;/code&gt;. An slug is the username and the name of a repository, e.g. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ospfranco/link-preview-js&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also select if you want to see branches and/or PRs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/CIDemonTut5.png&quot; alt=&quot;CI tut 5&quot; title=&quot;CI tut 5&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it, you should now be able to see your CI information right on your Desktop. If you haven’t heard about CI Demon, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ospfranco.github.io/cidemon&quot;&gt;you should check it out now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Oscar Franco</name></author><category term="post" /><summary type="html">CI Demon is an app I created to monitor my CI builds and deployments from my macOS desktop.

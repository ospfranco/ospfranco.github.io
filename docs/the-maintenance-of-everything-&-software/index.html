      <div class="pt-4 pb-20 markdown text-justify"><p>I’ve recently finished reading <a href="https://press.stripe.com/maintenance-part-one">Maintenance: Of Everything, Part One</a>. It’s a great book on how we constantly overlook maintaining the things we have already built. While it doesn’t speak of software, the chapter on Ford’s Model T vs the Rolls Royce “Silver Ghost” did spark an idea in my brain.</p>

<p>The first Roll Royce, dubbed the “Silver Ghost”, was hand-crafted to the point of filing individual bolts so they fit perfectly. It ran as silently and vibration free possible as a vehicle of the time could run. It was a marvel of its time, while also costing as much as a work of art can cost. The model T in the other hand was barely held together. Meant to be simple, replaceable and modifiable. There were barely roads at the time, so Ford expected owners to adapt the car and constantly repair it. The pieces and the car would run successfully even if the parts would not fit perfectly. It was a rackety car that basically functioned but nothing more. But because it could be modified and repaired somewhat easily it gained mass adoption and allowed many more people to gain access to a motor-vehicle, one they could own and adapt to their own situations. This also brought a cascade of innovation and wealth.</p>

<p>I despise LLMs. It’s not that they are not useful but people are completely surrendering their brains to the machine with all that that entails. It’s however hard to miss the connection here. We are moving into a time where software is loosely held-together with pieces that barely fit, yet allows for rapid iteration, customization and innovation via LLMs. I now consider myself from the time where software was a “Silver Ghost”, every bolt hand crafted in attempt to make the perfect machine (although reality is messy and software always ends-ups somewhat duct taped together). LLMs are still very flawed tools but they certainly allow the average-joe (dev or non-dev) to produce running software. Is it maintainable, secure and well-written software? of course not, but certainly opens new doors for people to modify their software.</p>

<p>There forces of history cannot be beaten and I’m curious where will all this leads (after the current hype and market bubbles pop). Will we have a model-T for building software or be doomed to eternally broken software from now-on?</p>

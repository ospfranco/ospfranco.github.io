        Reduce Rust binaries size

      <div class="pt-4 pb-20 markdown"><p>I find myself writing a lot of Rust nowadays. I’m by no means an expert, but I need to make do with my limited knowledge. A constant problem I’m facing is that the binaries outputted by Rust are huge. This is especially a problem on mobile, where each megabyte counts.</p>

<p>The documentation is a bit confusing, but here is the configuration I ended up using to get somewhat OK sizes. In the <code>cargo.toml</code> file:</p>

<pre><code class="language-toml">[profile.release] # When compiling in release mode
debug = false # Exclude debug symbols
strip = "symbols" # Exclude the rest of the symbols
# opt-level = "z" # Did not use this, but it equals C++'s optimize for size (O3?)
lto = true # Link time optimization, not sure what this does but it helps reduce the size
codegen-units = 1 # Cargo specifies 16 parallel codegen units for release builds. This improves compile times, but prevents some optimizations.
panic = "abort" # when Rust code encounters a situation when it must call panic!(), it unwinds the stack and produces a helpful backtrace. The unwinding code, however, does require extra binary size. rustc can be instructed to abort immediately rather than unwind, which removes the need for this extra unwinding code.
</code></pre>

<h1 id="cargo-bloat">Cargo Bloat</h1>

<p>I haven’t fully explored what this tool can do, but it does point to large sections of the code. Install it with <code>cargo install cargo-bloat</code> and then run:</p>

<pre><code>cargo bloat --release --target=&lt;your-target&gt;
</code></pre>

<h1 id="building-both-a-static-and-dylib">Building both a static and dylib</h1>

<p>In my experience static binaries on iOS are OK, but on Android they can be huge. Ideally you would specify <code>crate-type = ['staticlib', 'dylib']</code> and just be on your merry way, however, it seems there is a bug in the rust compiles and it bloats the static lib massively. In order to get a static binary for iOS and a dynamic one for Android you can set <code>crate-type = ['dylib']</code> and change the compilation command for iOS to <code>cargo rustc --crate-type=staticlib ...</code></p>

<h1 id="openssl">OpenSSL</h1>

<p>The OpenSSL adds a lot of weight to a crate unless you need it, you can use <a href="https://crates.io/crates/ring">ring</a> which reduced further 4 MB to 6 MB of my crate.</p>

<h1 id="further-reading">Further reading</h1>

<p><a href="https://github.com/johnthagen/min-sized-rust">Here is a great repo</a> with a lot more flags and tweaks, mostly under experimental flags or nightly Rust versions so use at your own risk.</p>

<h1 id="results">Results</h1>

<p>Using all the compile optimizations, I was able to reduce the output of one of my binaries from 66 MB to 24.7 MB. It’s still large but better.</p>

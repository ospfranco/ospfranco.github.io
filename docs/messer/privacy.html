  <p class="dark:text-white">
    Oscar Franco built the Messer app as a Commercial app. This SERVICE is
    provided by and is intended for use as is. This page is used to inform
    visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of
    Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service. If you choose to

    relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for
    providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your
    information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. The
    terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in in Terms and
    Conditions, which is accessible at Messer unless otherwise defined in this
    Privacy Policy.
  </p>
  <h2 class="dark:text-white font-bold pt-4 pb-2">Service Providers</h2>
  <p>
    I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following
    reasons: * To facilitate the Service; * To provide the Service on our
    behalf; * To perform Service-related services; or * To assist me in
    analyzing how the Service is used. I want to inform users of this Service
    that these third parties have access to your Personal Information. The
    reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on my behalf. However, they
    are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
  </p>

  <h2 class="dark:text-white font-bold pt-4 pb-2">Security</h2>
  <p>
    I value your trust in providing me your Personal Information, thus I am
    striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember
    that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic
    storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute
    security. **Links to Other Sites** This Service may contain links to other
    sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that
    site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I
    strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have
    no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy
    policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. **Childrenâ€™s
    Privacy** These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not
    knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under
    13\. In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with
    personal information, I immediately delete this from the servers. If you are
    a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided me with
    personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to do
    necessary actions.
  </p>

    effective immediately after they are posted on this page.

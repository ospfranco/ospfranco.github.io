  2 Scope of Application
  2.1 Parties to the contract and subject matter of the contract
  
  These General Terms and Conditions of Business form the basis of the user contract being formed between you and me, Oscar Franco, Gerhardstraße 21, 81543, Munich, Germany.

  I reserve the right to agree to additional terms and conditions for individual Messer Services. I will, however, notify you of this in good time prior to use.
  
  3 Messer’ Services and Prices
  3.1 Services free of charge or for a fee
  
  The scope of the services included in Messer and the Messer Services and available for use by you depends on the type of Messer Service and whether you use the Messer Services free of charge or for a fee. If you use it free of charge you only have access to certain basic functions and information of the respective Messer Service. A more extensive range of functions is available to you if you enable the premium features separately in return for a one-off payment or as part of a subscription for the respective Messer Service.
  
  3.2 Prices
  
  Current pricing is displayed inside of the application. All prices stated include the applicable VAT.
  
  4 Conclusion of a Contract
  How the respective contract is formed depends on the method by which you register for Messer for the first time and whether you sign up for additional fee-based services.
  
  5 Term of Validity
  5.1 User contract
  
  The user contract concluded between you and us once you register your account is valid for an indefinite period.
  You do not need to create an account to sign up for the premium service of Messer, it is however tied to your Apple Account, therefore as long as your Apple Account and payments are valid, you retain access to the premium features.
  
  5.2 Subscriptions
  
  Our subscriptions are offered with varying minimum terms of validity and are automatically renewed for the same minimum term that has been selected until you or we cancel them.
  In order to avoid any misunderstanding, please note that the term of a subscription is determined by calendar and is independent from your use or extent of your use of the respective Messer Service.
  
  6 Terms and Conditions of Payment
  6.1 Collection of fees
  
  Fees are collected when the contract is concluded for purchases of additional services through the payment of a one-off sum. The fee is collected for the relevant minimum term when the contract is concluded for the purchase of a subscription. If the subscription is renewed automatically, the fee is collected in advance at the start of the relevant renewal period. Different terms and conditions apply if the fee is collected via iTunes; in this case the fee is already collected 24 hours before the start of the respective billing period.
  
  6.2 Payment default
  
  We reserve the right to assert further claims for late payments.
  
  7 Payment Methods
  If you purchase Messer services for a fee via in-app purchases, the respective app-store supplier will bill you. Please consult this supplier to find out what payment methods are available.
  If we incur costs and/or expenses because a payment is declined and this is your fault (e.g. because there are insufficient funds in the account or the credit card limit has already been exhausted), then we are entitled to bill you for the actual costs and/or expenses incurred.
  Where there is a legitimate reason, we reserve the right for each purchase to refrain from offering certain payment methods and to specify alternative payment methods.
  
  8 Right of Withdrawal
  8.1 Withdrawal policy
  
  If you have entered into a contract for use of Messer or purchased a one-off additional service or a subscription, in each case, you are entitled to the following right of withdrawal.
  You have the right to withdrawal the contract within 14 days without stating any reasons. The cancellation period runs for 14 days from the conclusion of the contract.
  To exercise your right of withdrawal you must send us an unequivocal notification (e.g. a letter sent by post or an email) of your decision to withdraw the contract:

  8.2 Consequences of withdrawal
  
  If you withdraw from the contract we are obliged to refund all the payments that we have received from you, including the delivery costs (except for any additional costs incurred as a result of your choosing a different delivery method to the least expensive standard delivery method that we offer), promptly and at the latest within 14 days from the day on which we received the notification of your withdrawal of the contract. For this refund we will use the same payment method that you used for the original transaction unless a different arrangement has been expressly agreed with you; under no circumstances will you be charged any fees in respect of this refund.
  
  If you asked for the services to start during the withdrawal period you must pay us an appropriate amount, equal to the proportion of the services that have already been provided by the time you inform us that you are exercising your right to withdraw from this contract compared to the full scope of the services covered by the contract.
  
  8.3 Lapse of the right of withdrawal
  
  In the case of a contract for the provision of services the right of withdrawal lapses if we have provided the service in full and only began to perform the service after you gave your express approval and simultaneously confirmed that you were aware that you would lose your right of withdrawal if we had completely fulfilled the contract.
  
  In the case of a contract for the delivery of digital content that is not stored on a physical data carrier the right of withdrawal also lapses if we have begun to perform the contract after you gave your express approval and simultaneously confirmed that you were aware that you would lose your right of withdrawal once we had begun to perform the contract.

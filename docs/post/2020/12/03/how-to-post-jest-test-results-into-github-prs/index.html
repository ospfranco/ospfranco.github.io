      <div class="pt-4 pb-20 markdown"><p>At BodyFast we recently decided to migrate out of Bitrise for our javascript tests, that means, we continue to use Bitrise for building our react-native app but all other tests (jest, lint, flow, tsc) are now running on github actions</p>

<h2 id="why-leave-bitrise">Why leave Bitrise</h2>

<p>Bitrise is good because the amount of available workflows and steps and how you can chain them to create your CI workflow, however, it is <strong>really slow</strong> and it also <strong>expensive</strong> for faster build machines.</p>

<p>Even though we are already on a medium plan, we started having queueing slow downs, our app takes an hour to compile on iOS (plus Android and Huawei versions) and without paying more money everything slowed down, a simple PR would not get the tests to run for a solid hour blocking the entire team.</p>

<h2 id="github-actions-are-quite-good-actually">Github Actions are quite good actually</h2>

<p>They are fast, already run on the same platform where the code is, setting them up was a breeze and they are plenty fast</p>

<p>Getting things to run was a breeze, not a fan of yaml, but setting up the first iteration took 5 mins, here is a sample yaml:</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">name: JS Checks
on: push

jobs:
  tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Use Node.js 12.x
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2.1.2
        with:
          node-version: 12.x
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: yarn
      - name: Run tests
        uses: yarn test
</code></pre>

<p>However, I wanted to push things a bit further, I hated having to open the bitrise log page, because loading web pages nowadays is sooo slow, so I wanted to see my failing tests directly on my PR!</p>

<p>A quick google search revealed nothing of use</p>

<h2 id="introducing-gh-jester">Introducing gh-jester</h2>

<p>I forked an old project that claimed to do what I needed, removed the unnecessary parts and added actually the useful output that I was looking for, you can check the <a href="https://github.com/ospfranco/gh-jester">source code</a>, here is a finished YAML you can copy and paste into your github repo:</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">name: JS Checks
on: push

jobs:
  tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Cancel Previous Runs
        uses: styfle/cancel-workflow-action@0.6.0
        with:
          access_token: $
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Use Node.js 12.x
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2.1.2
        with:
          node-version: 12.x
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: yarn
      - name: Run tests
        uses: ospfranco/gh-jester@v1.0.13
        with:
          post-comment: true
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          GITHUB_CONTEXT: ${{ toJson(github) }}
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, it will run your jest tests and if the tests are failing it will post a nice resume on the commit itself (which will also appear on the PR), bear in mind, the trigger needs to be [push] for it to correctly post the comment with the info.</p>

<p><img src="https://ospfranco.com/assets/gh-jester.png" alt="gh-jester comment" title="gh-jester" /></p>

<p>And that is it! Now all the info for your PR is right on the comment section, enjoy!</p>

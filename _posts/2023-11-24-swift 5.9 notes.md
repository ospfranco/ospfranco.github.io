Swift 5.9 has enabled direct interop with C++. This means you can directly call and interact with C++, as well as introduced a series of objects that allow to interact with integral and C++ class values directly (e.g. `std::string`).

In order to enable the C++ interop, you need to be on XCode 15 (I think), and your projects needs to be Swift enabled. If you are not sure, you only need to add a Swift file and the bridging header will be created for you and all the Swift build settings will be enabled on XCode.

Afterwards you need to go into the `Build Settings` → `Swift Compiler - Language` → `C++ and Obj-C++ Interoperability` and change the value from C to C++

If you want to do the same in a CocoaPods project you need to modify the pod config like this:

```ruby
s.pod_target_xcconfig = {
  'SWIFT_OBJC_INTEROP_MODE' = 'objcxx'
}
```

Clang has issues with headers (it generates a module map, topic for another day). Instead of importing headers directly from your dependency, you should import the umbrella header.

```C++
#import <jsi/jsi.h>
```

You should import everything with

```C++
#import <mypod-umbrella.h>
```

Afterwards you are in the clear, you should be able to call any C++ function/class from your Swift code and viceversa.

I've recently finished reading [Maintenance: Of Everything, Part One](https://press.stripe.com/maintenance-part-one). It's a great book on how we constantly overlook maintaining the things we have already built. While it doesn't speak of software, there is a chapter on Ford's Model T vs the Rolls Royce "Silver Ghost", that I found interesting.

The first Roll Royce, dubbed the "Silver Ghost", was hand-crafted to the point of filing individual bolts so they fit perfectly. It ran as silently and vibration free as a vehicle of the time could run. It was a marvel of its time, while also costing as much as a work of art can cost. The model T in the other hand was barely held together. Meant to be simple, replaceable and modifiable. There were barely roads at the time, so Ford expected owners to adapt the car and constantly having to repair it. The car would run successfully even if the parts would not fit perfectly. It was a rackety machine that basically functioned but nothing more. But because it could be modified and repaired easily it gained mass adoption, one they could own and adapt to their own situations.

I despise LLMs. It's not that they are not useful but people are completely surrendering their brains to the machine with all that that entails. It is, however, hard to miss the resemblance here. We are moving into a time where software is loosely held-together with pieces that barely fit, yet allows for rapid iteration, customization and innovation via LLMs. I feel like I belong to the time where software was a "Silver Ghost", every bolt hand crafted in attempt to make the perfect machine (although reality is messy and software always ends-ups somewhat duct taped together). LLMs are still very flawed tools but they certainly allow the average-joe (dev or non-dev) to produce running code. Is it maintainable, secure and well-written software? of course not, but certainly opens new doors for tinkering and customization.

The forces of history cannot be beaten and I'm curious where all of this leads (after the current hype and market bubbles pop). Will we have a model-T for building software or be doomed to eternally broken software from now-on?
